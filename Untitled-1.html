                <h1>Hi there! Welcome to Sassafras Business Services.</h1>

                <p>I'm
                    <a href="#about-me">Sarah Waldie.</a> I'm a front-end web developer with a background in marketing
                    and
                    advertising. My passion is using
                    my experience to help people create a piece of the internet that they are proud to show off to the
                    world.
                    I especially enjoy working with fellow female entrepreneurs and moms!
                </p>
                <p>I offer a 10% Military Discount to our veterans and active military members.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>As we enter the holiday season, I am reflecting on the journey of 2018. I have had the opportunity to work with some incredible clients, and I've learned so much more about coding-especially through the completion of Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program. I'm excited for what's next! Let me know if you're interested in working together in the new year, or even kicking something off in the next month. Why wait!?</li>
                    <li>I just wrapped up two Squarespace projects-<a href="http://www.persea-consulting.com/" target="_blank>Persea Consulting</a> and <a href="http://thepartynewyork.com" target="_blank>The Party New York</a>.  Persea provides consulting and resources to developer relations professionals, and The Party New York is an event planning business covering everything from weddings to first birthdays. There's nothing like having a diverse client base to keep things interesting!</li>
                </ul>
